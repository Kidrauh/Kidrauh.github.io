# About me

Hi! I'm a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Vision at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. 

I obtained my B.Eng. in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University, where I worked on domain generalization and vision-language models under the supervision of [Prof. Xuming He](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/hexm/index.html). I was an exchange student at MIT in Spring 2023, where I was fortunate to join Medical Vision Group and work with [Prof. Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/) and [Dr. Neel Dey](https://www.neeldey.com/) on medical image analysis with neural rendering.

In my spare time, I find joy in playing basketball and capturing moments through photography.
